# Build the Docker image
# This creates an image named 'todo-mariadb' from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
docker build -t todo-mariadb .

# Run the container (first time)
# Starts a new container named 'todo-db' in detached mode (-d), mapping port 3306 on your host to 3306 in the container.
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name todo-db todo-mariadb

# Stop the container
# Stops the running 'todo-db' container but keeps its data and configuration intact.
docker stop todo-db

# Start the stopped container
# Restarts the existing 'todo-db' container without creating a new one, preserving its state.
docker start todo-db

# Additional Useful Commands:

# Check container status
# Lists all containers (running or stopped) to confirm 'todo-db' exists and its status.
docker ps -a

# Restart the container
# Stops and starts 'todo-db' in one command (useful if it’s already running).
docker restart todo-db

# Remove the container (if needed)
# Deletes 'todo-db' completely. Use with caution—data is lost unless persisted with a volume.
docker rm todo-db
# Note: You can’t remove a running container; stop it first with 'docker stop todo-db'.

# Run a new container if 'todo-db' was removed
# If you’ve deleted the container, this creates a new one from the 'todo-mariadb' image.
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name todo-db todo-mariadb

# Access the container’s MariaDB CLI
# Opens an interactive MySQL shell inside the container to run queries manually.
docker exec -it todo-db mysql -u todo_user -ptodo_pass

# View container logs
# Shows logs (e.g., MariaDB startup messages or errors) for troubleshooting.
docker logs todo-db

# Important Notes:
# - If you stop and start 'todo-db', its data persists because Docker keeps the container’s filesystem.
# - If you remove 'todo-db' and run a new one, the database resets to 'init.sql' unless you use a volume:
#   docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -v todo-data:/var/lib/mysql --name todo-db todo-mariadb
#   The '-v todo-data:/var/lib/mysql' mounts a named volume to persist data across container restarts/removals.
# - Port 3306 must be free on your host. If it’s in use, change the host port (e.g., -p 3307:3306).
